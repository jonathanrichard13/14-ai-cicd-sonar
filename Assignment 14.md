## Quality Gate Issues Fixed ✅

### **Before (Failed Quality Gate):**
- ❌ **20 Security Hotspots**
- ❌ **12.4% Coverage** (required ≥ 80%)
- ❌ **3.9% Duplication** (required ≤ 3%)
- ❌ **C Reliability Rating** (required ≥ A)

### **After (Passed Quality Gate):**
- ✅ **0 Security Hotspots** - Removed `eval()`, hardcoded credentials
- ✅ **100% Coverage** - Added comprehensive tests (34 tests across 4 suites)
- ✅ **0% Duplication** - Eliminated duplicate functions and files
- ✅ **A Reliability Rating** - Improved error handling and code quality
